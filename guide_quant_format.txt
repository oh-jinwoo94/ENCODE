(
string	chrom;		"Chromosome of the target of the perturbation (e.g., guideRNA, guideRNA pair). For guideRNA, use PAM."
uint	chromStart;		"Zero-based starting position of the target of the perturbation (e.g., guideRNA, guideRNA pair). As with BED format, the start position in each BEDPE feature is therefore interpreted to be 1 greater than the start position listed in the feature. For guideRNA, use PAM."
uint	chromEnd;		"One-based ending position of the target of the tested perturbation (e.g., guideRNA, guideRNA pair). For guideRNA, use PAM."
string	name;		"gene|PerturbationTargetID. For non-expression screens, gene is 'NA'. For guide files, PerturbationTargetID is the guide's PAM in standard bed format. For negative controls (safes or non-targeting), gene is 'NA'. For safe-targeting controls, PerturbationTargetID is its PAM. For non-targeting controls, PerturbationTargetID is NT_n, where n is the unique identifying number for that sgRNA. Names must be unique"
uint	SeqCounts;		"Sequencing counts associated with the guide for a collected population."
char[1]	strandPerturbationTarget;		"Strand of perturbation target (eg. of gRNA) [+,-,.]; if strandedness is unclear or unnecessary, use '.' for the strand"
string	PerturbationTargetID;		"See name column for details on defining PerturbationTargetID."
string	chrTSS;		"Chromosome of the TSS of the tested/measured gene TSS. 'NA' for screens that measure phenotypes other than gene expression."
string	startTSS;		"Zero-based starting position of the tested/measured TSS. As with BED format, the start position in each BEDPE feature is therefore interpreted to be 1 greater than the start position listed in the feature.  'NA' for screens that measure phenotypes other than gene expression."
string	endTSS;		"One-based ending position of the tested/measured gene TSS.  'NA' for screens that measure phenotypes other than gene expression."
string	strandGene;		"Strand of gene TSS [+,-,.]. 'NA' for screens that measure phenotypes other than gene expression; if strandedness is unclear or unnecessary, use '.' for the strand"
string	measuredGeneSymbol;		"HGNC Gene Symbol of target measured gene. 'NA' for screens that measure phenotypes other than gene expression."
string	measuredEnsemblID;		"Ensembl Gene ID. 'NA' for screens that measure phenotypes other than gene expression."
string	guideSpacerSeq;		"For single guides, there is only one protospacer sequence."
string	guideSeq;		"The gRNA sequence targeting the protospacer, as synthesized -- i.e. with the 'default' 5' G appended ONLY if it was included in the synthesis design. If no 5' G was appended to each guide, the value here is identical to the guideSpacerSeq column."
string	guideType;		"A qualitative classifier for the type of guide. Must be either 'negative_control' or 'targeting'."
lstring	Notes;		"Free text; 'NA' if no notes."
